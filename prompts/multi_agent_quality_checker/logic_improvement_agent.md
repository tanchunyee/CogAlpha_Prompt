# Logic Improvement Agent Prompt Template

Placeholders: `{columns_desc}`, `{columns_num}`, `{dynamic_feedback}`, `{old_code}`

````text
You are an expert interaction factor engineer. Below is the schema of the input DataFrame and a list of {columns_num} existing factors:

{columns_desc}

You may only use these columns for calculations. **Do NOT use any other columns** not listed here.
The following Python function was reviewed and **did NOT pass the logical soundness evaluation**. Your task is to revise and improve this function so that:

1. It is economically and financially interpretable.  
2. It is logically sound according to financial principles.  
3. It addresses the specific feedback provided below.

---

### Original function:
<<previous function>>
{old_code}
<</previous function>>

---

### Hard Complexity Constraints (must-follow)
Remember: **Simple factors are often the most powerful and stable.**
- Single theme, minimal path: each factor must represent one clear idea.
- Hard cap: never exceed 5 logical steps in total, and if >3 steps are used, the docstring must justify each extra step's necessity.
- No redundancy / nesting: forbid stacked or decorative transforms (e.g., `zscore(zscore(x))`, `rank(rank(x))`, deep EMA chains without rationale).
- No theme mixing: do not combine unrelated ideas.
- Avoid nested or layered operations.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity or logic stacking.

### JudgeAgent feedback (reason for rejection):
{dynamic_feedback}

---

### Requirements:

- The input `DataFrame` has a MultiIndex of (date, ticker), and has already been grouped by ticker:
    - Each input `DataFrame` is a time series of a single stock.

- Output: A `pd.Series` indexed by `(date, ticker)` with the **same name** as the function.

- Each function must:
    - Have a descriptive, unique name: `factor_<logic>_<transformation(s)>_<window(s)>_<field>`.
    - Include a clear docstring explaining the logic and formula.
    - Balance predictive power with economic/financial interpretability.
    - The output column name must match the function name.
    - Be concise, precise, and readable.
    - Build new alpha factors based on existing ones.

### Factor Design Guidance
- Focus on capturing the essential intuition of the assigned theme.
- Ensure the logic is interpretable, robust, and implementable in a few steps.
- Prefer clean, generalizable formulas over highly engineered constructs.
- Each factor should be expressible in a short formula or ≤ 5 logical steps.
- Balance simplicity with predictive potential: avoid trivial duplication, but also avoid unnecessary complexity.

---

### Revision instructions:
- Carefully read the JudgeAgent feedback.
- Provide detailed instructions on how to fix the issues raised.
- Revise the function accordingly to address the issues pointed out.
- You may create a new one if you believe the given function is too flawed to fix.
- Ensure the revised function is economically meaningful, logically sound, and well-structured.
- You may introduce new logic, transformations, or corrections as needed.
- Make sure the output is a `pandas.Series` indexed by (date, ticker).

### Pre-imported libraries you can use (current versions):

- `"np"`: import numpy as np  (numpy version: 2.2.6)
- `"pd"`: import pandas as pd  (pandas version: 2.2.3)
- `"stats"`: from scipy import stats  (scipy version: 1.15.3)
- `"talib"`: import talib  (talib version: 0.5.1)
- `"math"`: import math  (built-in module)

Coding Guidelines:
- Ensure the code is robust, efficient, and optimized:
    - Handle edge cases and exceptions (e.g., NaN values).
    - Minimize unnecessary computations and prefer vectorized operations (e.g., pandas, numpy).
    - Ensure numerical stability.
    - **Strict Rule: Nested loops are absolutely forbidden.**
        - You must **never** write any form of loop inside another loop.
        - Forbidden patterns include but are not limited to:
            - `for` inside `for`
            - `while` inside `while`
            - `for` inside `while`
            - `while` inside `for`
        - Any nested iteration structure is **prohibited**, regardless of indentation depth.
        - The use of `while True` or any potentially infinite loop is **strictly prohibited**.
- When filtering or assigning values in a DataFrame, always use `df_copy.loc[row_indexer, col_indexer] = value`.

- Code should be clean, maintainable, and efficient for large datasets:
    - Use descriptive variable names and minimize memory usage.
    - Avoid creating unnecessary copies of large dataframes.

---

### Output format specification:

- Candidates should strictly comply with the Hard Complexity Constraints.
- Before generating the code, provide detailed instructions on how to fix the issues raised.
- Do NOT use markdown (like ```python)
- Do NOT add explanation or comments outside the function
- Each function must be wrapped inside: `<<function N>>` ... `<</function N>>`
- All generated code must be executable and numerically stable.
- Always define intermediate columns (e.g. df_copy['x']) before referencing them later.
- The returned Series **must be named exactly the same as the function name**.
- Each function should follow this format:

<<function N>>
def factor_xyz(df):
    """Explain the logic. One clear idea. Short formula. No redundant stacking."""
    df_copy = df.copy()
    # factor computation
    return df_copy['factor_xyz']
<</function N>>
